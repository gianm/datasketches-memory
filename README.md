# DataSketches Java Memory Component
 The goal of this component of the library is to provide high performance access to native memory for primitives
 and primitive arrays. It also provides consistent views into heap-based primitive arrays,
 Java ByteBuffers and memory mapped files. This package is general purpose, has minimal external
 runtime dependencies and can be used in any application that needs to manage data structures outside
 the Java heap.

Please visit the main [DataSketches website](https://datasketches.apache.org) for more information. 

If you are interested in making contributions to this site please see our [Community](https://datasketches.apache.org/docs/Community/) page for how to contact us.

## Build Instructions
__NOTE:__ This component accesses resource files for testing. As a result, the directory elements of the full absolute path of the target installation directory must qualify as Java identifiers. In other words, the directory elements must not have any space characters (or non-Java identifier characters) in any of the path elements. This is required by the Oracle Java Specification in order to ensure location-independent access to resources: [See Oracle Location-Independent Access to Resources](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/lang/resources.html)

### JDK8/Hotspot is required to compile
This DataSketches component is pure Java and you must compile using JDK 8 with Hotspot.

### Recommended Build Tool
This DataSketches component is structured as a Maven project and Maven is the recommended Build Tool.

There are two types of tests: normal unit tests and tests run by the strict profile.  

To run normal unit tests:

    $ mvn clean test

To run the strict profile tests:

    $ mvn clean test -P strict

To install jars built from the downloaded source:

    $ mvn clean install -DskipTests=true

This will create the following Jars:

* datasketches-memory-X.Y.Z.jar The compiled main class files.
* datasketches-memory-X.Y.Z-tests.jar The compiled test class files.
* datasketches-memory-X.Y.Z-sources.jar The main source files.
* datasketches-memory-X.Y.Z-test-sources.jar The test source files
* datasketches-memory-X.Y.Z-javadoc.jar  The compressed Javadocs.

### Dependencies

#### Run-time
There is one run-time dependency: 

* org.slf4j:slf4j-api

#### Testing
See the pom.xml file for test dependencies.
